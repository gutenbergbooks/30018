<div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><span class="smcap">Dear Charlie</span>,&mdash;Bin down as a dab with that dashed heppydemick, dear boy.</p>
      <p>I 'ave bloomin' nigh sneezed my poor head orf. You know that there specie of toy</p>
      <p>Wot they call cup-and-ball! That's <i>me</i>, <span class="smcap">Charlie</span>! My back seemed to open and shut,</p>
      <p>As the <i>grippe</i>-demon danced on my innards, and played pitch-and-toss with my nut.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Hinfluenza be blowed! It licks hague and cholera rolled into one.</p>
      <p>The Sawbones have give it that name, I'm aware, but of course that's their fun.</p>
      <p>I've 'ad colds in the head by the hunderd, but <i>this</i> weren't no cold, leastways <i>mine</i>.</p>
      <p>Howsomever, I'm jest coming round a bit, thanks to warm slops and QyNine.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Took to reading, I did as I mended; that's mostly a practice with me.</p>
      <p>When I'm down on my back that's the time for a turn at my dear old <i>D. T.</i></p>
      <p>A party named <span class="smcap">Robert Buchanan</span>, as always appears on the job,</p>
      <p>Was a slating a chappie called <span class="smcap">Huxley</span>. Thinks I, I'll take stock of friend <span class="smcap">Bob</span>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Well, <i>he</i> ain't much account, that's a moral; a ramblinger Rad never wos.</p>
      <p>Old <span class="smcap">Huxley's</span> wuth ten on him, <span class="smcap">Charlie</span>, though <i>he's</i> rather huppish and poz.</p>
      <p>Are men really born free and equal? Ah! that's wot they're harguing hout.</p>
      <p><span class="smcap">Bob B.</span>, he says "Yus;" <span class="smcap">Huxley</span>, "No;" and <span class="smcap">Bob's</span> wrong, there's no manner of doubt.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Free and equal?" Oh, <span class="smcap">Nebuchadnezzar</span>! how <i>can</i> they talk sech tommy-rot?</p>
      <p>Might as well say as Fiz and Four-Arf should be equally fourpence a pot.</p>
      <p>Nice hidea, but <i>taint so</i>, that's the wust on it. There's where these dreamers go wrong.</p>
      <p>Ought's nothink, and that as is, <i>is</i>; all the rest isn't wuth a old Song.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Bad as <span class="smcap">Buggins</span>, the Radical Cobbler, these mugs are. Sez <span class="smcap">Buggins</span>, sez he,</p>
      <p>Wos it Nature give Mudford his millions, and three bob a day to poor me?</p>
      <p>Not a bit on it. Nature's a mother, and meant all her gifts <i>for</i> us all.</p>
      <p>It's a Law as gives Mudford his Castle, and leaves me a poor Cobbler's Stall.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>All I've got to say, <span class="smcap">Charlie</span>, is this. If so be Nature meant all that there,</p>
      <p>She must be a fair "J." as a mater. <i>I've</i> bin bested out of <i>my</i> share.</p>
      <p>So has <span class="smcap">Buggins</span>, and nine out o' ten on us. <i>If</i> the few nobble the quids</p>
      <p>Spite of Nature, wy Nature's a noodle as cannot purtect her own kids.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Poor <span class="smcap">Buggins!</span> He's nuts upon <span class="smcap">Henery George</span>, <span class="smcap">William Morris</span>, and such.</p>
      <p>He's got a white face, and is humpy, and lives in a sort of a hutch</p>
      <p>Smellin' strong of wax-end and stale dubbin. <i>Him</i> born free and equal? Great Scott!</p>
      <p>'Bout as free as a trained flea in harness, or sueties piled in a pot.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Nature's nothink, dear boy, simply nothink, and natural right don't exist,</p>
      <p>Unless it means natural flyness, or natural power of fist.</p>
      <p>It's brains and big biceps, wot wins. <i>Is</i> men equal in muscle and pith?</p>
      <p>Arsk <span class="smcap">Bismarck</span> and <span class="smcap">Derby</span>, dear boy, or arsk <span class="smcap">Jackson</span> the Black and <span class="smcap">Jem Smith</span>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>There'd be precious few larks if they wos, <span class="smcap">Charlie</span>&mdash;where'd be the chance of a spree</p>
      <p>If every pious old pump or young mug was the equal of Me?</p>
      <p>It's the up-and-down bizness of life, mate, as makes it such fun&mdash;for the ups.</p>
      <p>Equal? Yus, as old <span class="smcap">Barnum</span> and <span class="smcap">Buggins</span>, or tigers and tarrier pups.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>He's a long-winded lot, is <span class="smcap">Buchanan</span>, slops over tremenjous, he do;</p>
      <p>Kinder poet, dear boy, I believe, and they always do flop round a few,</p>
      <p>Make a rare lot o' splash and no progress, like ducks in a tub, dontcher know,</p>
      <p>But cackle and splutter ain't swimming; so <span class="smcap">Robert</span>, my nabs, it's no go.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Men ain't equal a mite, that's a moral, and patter won't level 'em up.</p>
      <p>Wy yer might as well talk of a popgun a holding its own with a Krupp.</p>
      <p>'Ow the brains and the ochre got fust ladled hout is a bit beyond me,</p>
      <p>But to fancy as them as <i>has</i> got 'em will part is dashed fiddle-de-dee.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Normans nicked? Landlords copped? Lawyers fiddled? Quite likely; I dessay they did.</p>
      <p>Are they going to hand back the swag arter years? Not a hacre or quid!</p>
      <p>Finding's keeping, and 'olding means 'aving. I wish <i>I</i>'d a spanking estate</p>
      <p>Wot my hancestors nailed on the ready. They wouldn't wipe me orf the slate.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>No fear, <span class="smcap">Charlie</span>, my boy! I'd hang on by my eyelids; and so will the nobs,</p>
      <p>Despite Mounseer Roosso's palaver or rattletrap rubbish like <span class="smcap">Bob's</span>.</p>
      <p>As <span class="smcap">Huxley</span> sez, Robbery's whitewashed by centries of toffdom, dear boy.</p>
      <p>Poor pilgarlicks whose forbears wos honest rich perks earn't expect to enjoy.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Life's a great game of grab, fur's <i>I</i> see, <span class="smcap">Charlie</span>. Robbery? Well, <i>call</i> it that.</p>
      <p>If you only lay hands on your own, mate, you won't git remarkable fat.</p>
      <p>There isn't enough to go round and yet give a fair dollop to each,</p>
      <p>It's a fight for front place, and he's lucky who gets the first bite at the peach.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>High priori</i> hideas about Justice, as <span class="smcap">Huxley</span> declares, is all rot.</p>
      <p>Fancy tigers dividing a carcase, and portioning each his fair lot!</p>
      <p>"Aren't men better than tigers?" cries <span class="smcap">Buggins</span>. Well, yus, there's religion and law;</p>
      <p>Pooty fakes! But when <i>sharing's</i> the word they ain't in it with sheer tooth and claw.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Orful nice to see Science confirming wot <i>I</i> always held. Blow me tight,</p>
      <p>If I don't rayther cotton to <span class="smcap">Huxley</span>; he's racy, old pal, and he's right.</p>
      <p>The skim-milk of life's for the many, the lardy few lap up the cream,</p>
      <p>And all talk about trimming the balance is rubbish, a mere Roosso's Dream!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Philanterpy's all very nice as a plaything for soft-'arted toffs,</p>
      <p>Kep in bounds it don't do no great 'arm. Poor old <span class="smcap">Buggins</span>, he flushes and coughs;</p>
      <p>Gets hangry, he do, at my talk. I sez, keep on your hair, my good bloke,</p>
      <p>Hindignation ain't good for your chest; cut this Sosherlist cant, or <i>you'll</i> choke.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Philanterpy squared in a system would play up Old Nick with the Great,</p>
      <p>As 'cute Bishop <span class="smcap">Magee</span> sez Religion would do&mdash;<i>carried out</i>&mdash;with the State.</p>
      <p>Oh, when Science and Saintship shake hands, in a sperret of sound common sense,</p>
      <p>To chuck over the cant of the Pulpit, by Jingo, old pal, it's Himmense!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>All cop and no blue ain't <i>my</i> motter; I likes to stand treat to a chum;</p>
      <p>And if I wos flush of the ochre, I tell yer I'd make the thing hum.</p>
      <p>And there's lots o' the rich is good parters; bit here and bit there, dontcher know;</p>
      <p>But shake up the Bag and share round, like good pals a pot-lucking? Oh no!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Wot these jokers call Justice means knocking all 'andicap out of life's race;</p>
      <p>"Equal chances all round," they declare, wouldn't give equal power and pace!</p>
      <p>Wy, no; but if things weren't made nice for the few with the power and the tin,</p>
      <p>The 'andicapped many would be in the 'unt, and some on 'em might <i>win</i>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Pooty nice state o' things for the perkers! Luck, Law, and the Longheads, dear boy,</p>
      <p>Have arranged the world so that the many must work that the few may enjoy.</p>
      <p>These "Equality" jossers would spile it; if arf their reforms they can carry,</p>
      <p>The enjoyers will 'ave a rough time, and there won't be a look in for '<span class="smcap">Arry</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Royal Berkshire.</span>&mdash;Go to <span class="smcap">Dowdeswell's</span>, in Bond Street, and they will
show you how County-history is written in the present day. It is
altogether different to the dull, old, dry volumes, "the musty
histories," which our grandfathers exhibited on their shelves, but
never took down to read; and these County-historians are of a much
more entertaining character. Those who know Royal Berkshire well&mdash;as
most of us do&mdash;will be glad to have their memory refreshed by the
fresh, bright, breezy pictures by <span class="smcap">Yeend King</span>, <span class="smcap">John M. Bromley</span>, and <span class="smcap">J.
M. Mackintosh</span>. <span class="smcap">Keeley Halswelle's</span> superb painting of "<i>Royal Windsor</i>"
occupies the place of honour in the room. It is one of the best
pictures&mdash;and at the same time one of the most unconventional&mdash;ever
produced of this oft-painted subject.</p>

<h2>SHOOTING ARROWS AT A SONG.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;I observe, that a gentleman has written, in a book
called <i>In Tennyson Land</i>, an account of the exact localities of "the
Moated Grange," and other well-advertised places&mdash;statements, which
however, have been promptly challenged by the Poet's son in the
<i>Athen&aelig;um</i>. As there seems to be some doubt upon this subject,
perhaps, you will allow me to give a few notes anent the interesting
objects which Lord <span class="smcap">Tennyson</span> has so obligingly immortalised in song.</p>

<p><i>The Owl.</i>&mdash;The name of a bright little newspaper which, amongst other
items of news and flashes of humour, gave a list of proposed
marriages&mdash;hence, no doubt, the refrain of "To wit and to woo." It
owed its temporary success both to its fun and its matrimonial
intelligence.</p>

<p><i>The Dying Swan.</i>&mdash;Probably, suggested by the condition of one of
these interesting creatures on the Thames, whose plumage had changed
from white to blue, owing to the River being made the temporary
repository for the outcome of some chemical works.</p>

<p><i>Oriana.</i>&mdash;This name, there is every reason to believe, was suggested
by a character in the opening of a pantomime at one of the minor
theatres, very popular some twenty or thirty years ago.</p>

<p><i>The Miller's Daughter.</i>&mdash;A very touching reference to the domestic
life of a hero of the Prize Ring.</p>

<p><i>Lady Clara Vere de Vere.</i>&mdash;Tradition has it that this aristocratic
sounding title was originally intended for a new sort of velveteen,
that would have been sold at a profit at three-and-sixpence a yard,
double width.</p>

<p><i>The May Queen.</i>&mdash;Believed to have been changed at the last moment
from "The Jack-in-the-Green," a subject that had already been used by
a poet of smaller fame than <span class="smcap">Alfred Tennyson</span>.</p>

<p><i>The Lotos Eaters.</i>&mdash;No doubt adapted from the English translation to
a German picture of some children playing at a once well-known game
called "The Loto Seaters."</p>

<p><i>The Northern Cobbler.</i>&mdash;Suggested by a favourite coal, supplied to
this day from Newcastle.</p>

<p><i>The Moated Grange.</i>&mdash;The site of the original still exists at
Haverstock Hill, and was fifty years ago more remote than it is now.
Hence the title of one of the most pleasing little poems of
comparatively modern times.</p>

<p>Trusting that these hints may be of service to those who take an
interest in Lord <span class="smcap">Tennyson's</span> very entertaining works, I remain, my dear
<i>Mr. Punch</i>, yours sincerely,</p>

<p><i>Lady Belledame</i> (<i>discovered preparing parcels</i>). Old and
unloved!&mdash;yes, the longer I live, the more plainly do I perceive that
I am <i>not</i> a popular old woman. Have I not acquired the reputation in
the county of being a witch? My neighbour, Sir <span class="smcap">Vevey Long</span>, asked me
publicly only the other day "when I would like my broom ordered," and
that minx, Lady <span class="smcap">Violet Powdray</span>, has pointedly mentioned old
cats in my hearing! <span class="smcap">Pergament</span>, my family lawyer, has
declined to act for me any longer, merely because <span class="smcap">Monkshood</span>
rack-rented some of the tenants a little too energetically in the
Torture Chamber&mdash;as if in these hard times one was not justified in
putting the screw on! Then the villagers scowl when I pass; the very
children shrink from me&mdash;[<i>A childish voice outside window</i>: "Yah, 'oo
sold 'erself to Old Bogie for a pound o' tea an' a set o' noo
teeth?"]&mdash;that is, when they do not insult me by suggestions of
bargains that are not even businesslike! No matter&mdash;I will be avenged
upon them all&mdash;ay, all! 'Tis Christmas-time&mdash;the season at which
sentimental fools exchange gifts and good wishes. For once I, too,
will distribute a few seasonable presents.... (<i>Inspecting parcels.</i>)
Are my arrangements complete? The bundle of choice cigars, in each of
which a charge of nitro-glycerine has been dexterously inserted? The
lip-salve, made up from my own prescription with corrosive sublimate
by a venal chemist in the vicinity? The art flower-pot, containing a
fine specimen of the Upas plant, swathed in impermeable sacking? The
sweets compounded with sugar of lead? The packet of best ratsbane?
Yes, nothing has been omitted. Now to summon my faithful <span class="smcap">Monkshood</span>....
Ha! he is already at hand.</p>

<p style='text-align: center;'>[<i>Chord as</i> <span class="smcap">Monkshood</span> <i>enters</i>.</p>

<p><i>Monkshood.</i> Your Ladyship, a child, whose sole luggage is a small
bandbox and a large banjo, is without, and requests the favour of a
personal interview.</p>

<p><i>Lady B.</i> (<i>reproachfully</i>). And you, who have been with me all these
years, and know my ways, omitted to let loose the bloodhounds? You
grow careless, <span class="smcap">Monkshood</span>!</p>

<p><i>Monks.</i> (<i>wounded</i>). Your Ladyship is unjust&mdash;I <i>did</i> unloose the
bloodhounds; but the ferocious animals merely sat up and begged. The
child had took the precaution to provide herself with a bun!</p>

<p><i>Lady B.</i> No matter, she must be removed&mdash;I care not how.</p>

<p><i>Monks.</i> There may be room for one more&mdash;a little one&mdash;in the old
well. The child mentioned that she was your Ladyship's granddaughter,
but I presume that will make no difference?</p>

<p><i>Lady B.</i> (<i>disquieted</i>). What!&mdash;then she must be the child of my only
son <span class="smcap">Poldoodle</span>, whom, for refusing to cut off the entail, I had falsely
accused of adulterating milk, and transported beyond the seas! She
comes hither to denounce and reproach me! <span class="smcap">Monkshood</span>, she must not
leave this place alive&mdash;you hear?</p>

<p><i>Monks.</i> I require no second bidding&mdash;ha, the child ... she comes!</p>

<p style='text-align: center;'>[<i>Chord.</i> <i>Little</i> <span class="smcap">Elfie</span> <i>trips in with touching self-confidence.</i></p>

<p><i>Elfie</i> (<i>in a charming little Cockney accent</i>). Yes, Grandma, it's
me&mdash;little <span class="smcap">Elfie</span>, come all the way from Australia to see you, because
I thought you must be sow lownly all by yourself! My Papa often told
me what a long score he owed you, and how he hoped to pay you off if
he lived. But he went out to business one day&mdash;Pa was a bushranger,
you know, and worked&mdash;oh, <i>so</i> hard; and never came back to his little
<span class="smcap">Elfie</span>, so poor little <span class="smcap">Elfie</span> has come to live with you!</p>

<p><i>Monks.</i> Will you have the child removed now, my Lady?</p>

<p><i>Lady B.</i> (<i>undecidedly</i>). Not now&mdash;not yet; I have other work for
you. These Christmas gifts, to be distributed amongst my good friends
and neighbours (<i>handing parcels</i>). First, this bundle of cigars to
Sir <span class="smcap">Vevey Long</span>, with my best wishes that such a connoisseur in tobacco
may find them sufficiently strong. The salve for Lady <span class="smcap">Violet Powdray</span>,
with my love, and it should be rubbed on the last thing at night. The
plant you will take to the little <span class="smcap">Pergaments</span>&mdash;'twill serve them for a
Christmas tree. This packet to be diluted in a barrel of beer, which
you will see broached upon the village green; these sweetmeats for
distribution among the most deserving of the school-children.</p>

<p><i>Elfie</i> (<i>throwing her arms around</i> Lady B.'s <i>neck</i>). I <i>do</i> like
you, Grandma; you have such a kind face! And oh, what pains you must
have taken to find something that will do for everybody!</p>

<p><i>Lady B.</i> (<i>disengaging herself peevishly</i>). Yes, yes, child. I trust
that what I have chosen will indeed do for everybody,&mdash;but I do not
like to be messed about. <span class="smcap">Monkshood</span>, you know what you have to do.</p>

<p><i>Elfie.</i> Oh, I am sure he does, Grandma! See how benevolently he
smiles. You're such a good old man, you will take care that all the
poor people are fed, <i>won't</i> you?</p>

<p><i>Monks.</i> (<i>with a sinister smile</i>). Ah! Missie, I've 'elped to settle
a many people's 'ash in my time!</p>

<p><i>Elfie</i> (<i>innocently</i>). What, do they all get hash? How nice! I like
hash,&mdash;but what else do you give them?</p>

<p><i>Monks.</i> (<i>grimly</i>). Gruel, Missie. (<i>Aside.</i>) I must get out of this,
or this innocent child's prattle will unman me!</p>
<p style='text-align: center;'>[<i>Exit with parcels.</i></p>

<p><i>Elfie.</i> You seem so sad and troubled, Grandma. Let me sing you one of
the songs with which I drew a smile from poor dear Pa in happier days.</p>

<p><i>Lady B.</i> No, no, some other time. (<i>Aside.</i>) Pshaw! why should I
dread the effect of her simple melodies? Sing, child, if you will.</p>

<h2>MODERN TYPES.</h2>

<h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Own Type-writer.</i>)</h4>

<h3>No. I.&mdash;THE DULL ROYSTERER.</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width:25%">
    <a href="images/p08901.png"><img width="100%" src="images/p08901.png" alt="Modern types" /></a>
</div>

<p>The Dull Roysterer, or, as he is termed by the slangiest of his
intimates, the "Bluff Boozer," is ordinarily the son of a wealthy, but
injudicious father, who, having sent him to a good public school,
furnished him with an income that would keep a curate in luxury. He
developes an early inclination for check trousers, and the pleasures
of the table. Appalled by the difficulties of English spelling, he
seeks comfort in Scotch whiskey, and atones for a profound distaste
for the tongues of ancient Greece and Rome by cultivating an
appreciative palate for the vintages of Modern France. His burly
frame, and a certain brute courage, gain for him a place in the School
Football team, and a considerable amount of popularity, which he
increases by the lavish waste of his excessive allowance. He has a
fine contempt, which he never fails to express, for those boys who
attempt to cultivate their minds by the reading of books, and,
naturally, does not hesitate to degrade his own by the immoderate
absorption of strong drinks.</p>

<p>Having, however, been discovered in a state of intoxication, he leaves
school hurriedly and betakes himself to an Army-crammer's where
discipline is lax and dissipation easy. Here he keeps half-a-dozen
fox-terriers, and busies himself about the destruction of domestic
cats. Yet, by dint of much forcing on the part of his Coach, he
succeeds in passing into Sandhurst, and eventually obtains a
commission in a Cavalry Regiment. During this stage of his career he
frequents race-courses and worships earnestly at the shrine of
Bacchus. He entangles himself with the wife of a brother officer, and,
after figuring as the co-respondent in an undefended case, marries
her. In the meantime he sends in his papers, and retires from the
Army. Shortly afterwards he enlists in the ranks of those who seek
pleasure in the night-resorts of the town. He soon becomes the boon
companion of shady sporting men, latter-day coachmen, pink and
paragraphic journalists, and middle-aged ladies, who, having once
been, or been once, on the stage, still affect the skittish manners of
a ballet-dancer. He is a man of short speech, but his humour is as
broad as his drinks are long. He affects a rowdy geniality and a
swaggering gait, by which he seeks to overawe the inoffensive. Though
he has but a small stock of intelligence, he passes for a wit amongst
his associates by dint of perpetually repeating an inane catch-word.
With this, and a stamp of the foot, he will greet a friend who may
meet him before lunch. Amongst his intimates such a welcome is held to
be intensely humorous. He scatters the same sort of stamp and the
identical remark broadcast over the loungers who congregate in front
of <span class="smcap">Hatchett's</span>; by these signs and tokens he announces his presence at
a Sporting Restaurant, and to the same accompaniment he sups at the
Camellia, or looks on, in a heavy, sodden sort of way, while others
dance, at the ball of a <i>demi-mondaine</i>.</p>

<p>Yet his general ignorance leads him into perpetual pitfalls, and makes
him the butt of those of his associates who are cleverer than himself.
Having on a certain occasion been addressed as Falstaff, in delicate
allusion to his size and capacity for drink, he is easily persuaded
that the original owner of this name was celebrated in history for his
grace and sobriety. He takes much pride in recounting the incident
ever afterwards.</p>

<p>Though the Roysterer is generally fuddled, he is rarely glorious.
Having once driven a tandem, he is credited with a complete knowledge
of horses, which, however, he invariably fails to turn to any
profitable account. He begins his day with whiskey cock-tails,
continues it with a series of brandy-and-sodas, followed by unlimited
magnums of <i>brut</i> Champagne, and concludes it with more Champagne, a
liberal allowance of liqueur brandies, and two or three tumblers of
whiskey-and-seltzer to round off the night. As the hours advance, his
face assumes a ruddier glow. With the progress of years, being
compelled to conceal the increasing girth of his lower chest by the
constant inflation of his upper, he wears frock-coats. The point which
is lacking in his conversation is conspicuous in his boots, whilst his
collars possess an elevation entirely denied to his manners.</p>

<p>He suffers from no restraint in consequence of his marriage. He is
adored by a certain class of burlesque actresses. He flatters them by
adoring himself. He owns a small house in Belgravia, but he frequently
lives elsewhere. No pigeon-shooting matches, and few poker parties,
amongst a certain set, are complete without him. Having benefited only
to a limited extent under the will of his father, he is not generally
reputed to be wealthy, but he is always extravagant. Yet he manages to
steer clear of the painful consequences of writs with some astuteness.
In middle-age he becomes obese, and cannot go the pace as formerly.
His friends therefore abandon him, and he dies before he is fifty, in
reduced circumstances, of an enlarged liver.</p>

<h2>"JOHNNYKIN AND THE GOBLINGS."</h2>

</div>

<p>Two hundred and fifty Goblings in the Grand Banquet room of the Hotel
M&eacute;tropole assembled, as all the world knows by this time, to bid
"Farewell, but not good-bye," as <span class="smcap">Clement Scott's</span> admirable verses have
it, to <span class="smcap">Johnnykin</span>; that is, to Mr. <span class="smcap">J. L. Toole</span>, usually and popularly
spoken of as "<span class="smcap">Johnnie Toole</span>," and generally endeared to his private
friends as, simply, "<span class="smcap">Johnnie</span>." Quite the best specimen of a "<span class="smcap">Johnnie</span>,"
among all the "Johnnies" of the present time. <i>Mr. Punch</i>, for the
first time in his life, permitted his merry men, The Knights of His
Own Round Table, to convert their usual Wednesday dinner into a
"movable feast," and to transfer it to the day beforehand, in order to
do honour to the unique occasion, and the exceptional guest of the
evening. No wonder there were two hundred and fifty acceptances to the
bill of fare, and two hundred and fifty more ready to sign, seeing
that the invitations came in effect from the President, the
Solicitor-General, who could not solicit in vain.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frank Lockwood</span>, Q.C., M.P., excelled himself in proposing the
toast of "The Drama." He contemned the ancient Greek Drama, but was of
opinion&mdash;Counsel's opinion&mdash;or, as he was speaking of the Romans,
"Consul's opinion"&mdash;that there was "more money in the Latin Drama."
<i>Mr. Punch</i>, regretted he was not at his learned friend's elbow to
suggest, that an apt illustration of the truth of his remark might be
found in the success of <span class="smcap">Augustus Druriolanus, Imperator</span>.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Henry Irving</span> proved, by his perfect recital of <span class="smcap">Clement Scott's</span>
verses, how thoroughly "by heart" he had got them. <span class="smcap">Henry's</span> "heart is"
<i>not</i> "dead" when <span class="smcap">Johnnie</span> is concerned. Sir <span class="smcap">Edward Clarke</span>, as we
learnt from the speeches made by himself, Mr. <span class="smcap">Irving</span>, and Mr. <span class="smcap">Toole</span>,
seems to have been at school with all the leading Actors; and it was a
miracle that he escaped the attractions of the sock and buskin. Pity
that the song, "When we were boys, Merry merry boys, When we were boys
together," had not been arranged as a trio for them. <span class="smcap">Johnnie</span> was in
his best form; very detached, casual, and uncommonly funny. Lord
<span class="smcap">Rosebery</span> apologised by letter for not being able to be in Scotland and
London at the same time; and the Wicked Abb&eacute; <span class="smcap">Bancroft</span> in replying to
the toast of the Drama, pathetically represented his hard case of
being called upon to make an after-dinner speech, when he hadn't had
any dinner. The Actor's lot is evidently, not always a happy one. He
wanted a "feeding-part" and didn't get it. The dinner was excellent,
and the waiting of the waiters was, as far as I could ascertain,
exceptionally good. Certainly the M&eacute;tropole, or the New "Holland"
House,&mdash;as it might be termed, after its manager,&mdash;holds first rank
for this sort of business. We present Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>, the M&eacute;tropole
Caterer, with this suggestion:&mdash;</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p><i>Leaves of a Life.</i> So <span class="smcap">Montagu Williams</span>, Q.C., and Worthy Beak, styles
his Reminiscences. The Leaves are fresh, and will be Evergreen.
Nothing in his Life has become him so well as his leave-ing it. I
fancy that the most popular part of it will be the early days&mdash;his
salad days&mdash;when his leaves were at their greenest. Certainly, to all
old Etonians, the opening of Volume One must prove the most
interesting part of the two books; and after this, in point of
interest to the general reader, will rank all the stories about
persons whose names, for evident reasons, the learned Reminiscenser
cannot give in full. When you read about what enormities "C&mdash;&mdash;"
committed, and what an unmitigated scoundrel "D&mdash;&mdash;'s" brother was,
there is in the narrative a delightful element of mystery, and an
inducement to guess, which will excite in many a strong desire for a
private key, which, of course, could not be placed in any publisher's
hands, except under such conditions as hamper the trustee of the
<i>Talleyrand Memoirs</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span> has better stories of Sergeant <span class="smcap">Ballantine</span> than the latter
had of himself in his own book. But I should like more of the <span class="smcap">Montagu</span>
out of Court&mdash;more of the behind-the-scenes of the cases in which he
was engaged or interested. All his book is written in a dashing style,
and there would be an enormous demand for a third volume, which might
be all dash&mdash;C&mdash;&mdash; D&mdash;&mdash; E&mdash;&mdash;; every letter of the alphabet dash&mdash;a
dash'd good book, in fact, giving us the toothsome <i>fond d'artichaut</i>
after the "leaves" have been disposed of. But that this should be the
strong feeling expressed not alone by the Baron <span class="smcap">De B.-w.,</span> but by very
many readers, is proof sufficient of the art with which these
Reminiscences have been compiled, so as, according to <i>Sam Weller's</i>
prescription for a love-letter, to make us "wish there was more of
it." By the way, I doubt whether <span class="smcap">Whateley's</span> <i>Evidences of
Christianity</i> was the work that <span class="smcap">Montagu Williams</span> was dozing over
during "Sunday Private" in pupil-room; doesn't he mean <span class="smcap">Paley's</span>
<i>Evidences</i>? Also, wasn't the old College Fellow's name spelt <span class="smcap">Plumtre</span>,
or <span class="smcap">Plumptre</span>, not <span class="smcap">Plumptree</span>? However, the Baron is less likely to be
right than the Magistrate, who is evidently blessed with a wonderfully
retentive memory.</p>

<p>My faithful Co. reports that he has read <i>On the Children</i>, a not very
interesting novel, by <span class="smcap">Annie Thomas</span>, otherwise Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pender Cudlip</span>. The
story deals with a young girl, who, after serving in a village
newspaper shop, marries the local nobleman, and no doubt lives happily
ever afterwards. Persons who are interested in the doings of the class
<span class="smcap">Jeames</span> calls the "hupper suckles," will perhaps be a little
disappointed, as, truth to tell, the narrative is rather homely. Many
of the characters seem to have that exaggerated awe of rank which used
to be characteristic of the tales in the <i>London Journal</i>. The book
should, however, be welcome in the homes of some of the lower middle
class.</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT,<br/>
EXTRACTED FROM The DIARY Of TOBY M.P.</h2>

<p><i>House of Commons, Tuesday, February 11.</i>&mdash;"Rather slow this," said
Commandant (of the Yeomanry Cavalry) Lord <span class="smcap">Brooke</span> to Admiral (in black
velvet suit, with silver buckles) <span class="smcap">Royden</span>.</p>

<p>They were locked up in a room adjoining <span class="smcap">Old Morality's</span> private
apartment, at back of <span class="smcap">Speaker's</span> chair. Both dressed in warlike
costumes, both uniforms new, unaccustomed, and uncomfortable. Both
warriors had waked in the morning full of joy and proud anticipation.
"If you're waking call me early," Quartermaster-General Lord <span class="smcap">Brooke</span>
had said to his man; "this is the happiest day of all the bright new
year; for I'm to Second the Address. Yes, I'm to Second the Address."</p>

<p>Captain <span class="smcap">Royden</span> had made a remark of a similar purport to his body
servant, though he had kept more closely to prose. Now here they were
locked in, with a glass of sherry wine and a sponge cake, waiting for
the signal that might never come. Ordinary course on <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>opening night of
Session is, for <span class="smcap">Speaker</span> to take Chair; Notices of Motion to be worked
off; Queen's Speech read; then Mover and Seconder of Address march
into seats immediately behind Ministers, especially kept for them;
dexterously dodge tendency of sword to get between their knees; sit
down with the consciousness that they are the cynosure of every eye,
including those of <span class="smcap">Joseph Gillis</span>, regarding them across House through
horn-bound spectacles. To-day everything upside down. Instead of
moving the Address, <span class="smcap">Harcourt</span> on with question of Privilege&mdash;<span class="smcap">Harcourt</span>,
a plain man, in civilian costume! Worst of it was, they could not go
away and change their clothes. No one knows what may happen from hour
to hour in House of Commons; debate on Privilege might break down;
Address brought on, and what would happen to British Constitution if
Mover and Seconder were dragged in in their dressing-gowns?</p>

<p>"Dem'd dull," said Captain of Yeomanry Cavalry Lord <span class="smcap">Brooke</span>, toying
with his sword-tassel.</p>

<p>"Trenormous!" yawned Bosun's Mate <span class="smcap">Royden</span>, loosening his belt, for he
had been beguiled into taking another sponge-cake. "If they'd only let
us walk about the corridors, or lounge in the House, it would be
better. But to sit cooped up here is terrible. Worst of it is I've
conned my speech over so often, got it mixed up; end turning up in
middle; exordium marching in with rear-guard; was just right to go off
at half-past six; now it's eight, and we won't be off duty till
twelve."</p>

<p>Vice-Admiral <span class="smcap">Royden</span> feebly hitched up his trousers; sadly sipped his
sherry wine, and deep silence fell on the forlorn company.</p>

<p>No one in crowded House thought of these miserable men. <span class="smcap">Harcourt</span> made
his speech; <span class="smcap">Gorst</span> demonstrated that Motion was indefensible, being
both too late and too soon; the Mouse came and went amid a spasm of
thrilled interest; <span class="smcap">Gladstone</span> delivered oration in dinner-hour; <span class="smcap">Parnell</span>
fired up at midnight; House divided, and <span class="smcap">Speaker</span> left the Chair. Then
was heard the rattling of keys in the door by <span class="smcap">Old Morality's</span> room; two
limp warriors were led forth; conducted to four-wheel cab; delivered
at their own doorways, to spend night in pleased reflection on the
distinction of Moving and Seconding the Address.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Charge of Breach of Privilege against <i>Times</i>,
negatived by 260 Votes against 212.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;House met at Noon as usual on Wednesdays; the two men of
war in their places in full uniform, which looked a little creased as
if they had slept in it. The eye that has sternly reviewed the
Warwickshire Yeomanry Cavalry, lacks something of its wonted
brightness; whilst <span class="smcap">Royden's</span> black velvet suit sets off the added
pallor of a countenance that tells of sleepless vigil.</p>

<p>House nearly empty; Members won't turn up at Noon even to hear the
thrilling eloquence clothing the original thoughts of the Mover and
Seconder of the Address. Amid the dreary space the stalwart figure of
<span class="smcap">George Hawkesworth Bond</span>, Member for the East Division of Dorset,
stands forth like a monument. Curious to see how <span class="smcap">Bond</span> avoids vicinity
of Cross Benches. Was standing there in contemplative attitude last
night, whilst <span class="smcap">Gorst</span> was demonstrating that <span class="smcap">Harcourt's</span> Motion on Breach
of Privilege was, (1) too late, and (2) that it was too soon. It was
at this moment that the Mouse appeared on the scene, leisurely
strolling down floor apparently going to join the majority. A
view-halloa started him; doubled and made for Cross Benches; BOND,
awakened out of reverie by the shout, looked down and saw the strange
apparition. Never believed a man of his weight could get so high up
into the air by sudden swift gyration. Mouse, more frightened even
than the man, dodged <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>round the Benches and disappeared. "All very
well once in a way," said <span class="smcap">Bond</span> this afternoon, sinking into a seat far
removed from the Cross Benches; "but it is foolish unnecessarily to
court danger; won't catch <i>me</i> standing at the bar any more when <span class="smcap">Gorst</span>
is orating."</p>

    <p style='text-align: center;'>Before the Mouse came.</p>
</div>


<p>And his word is as good as his Bond.</p>

<p>After Mover and Seconder had completed their story, Grand Old Man
appeared at the table, and talked for nearly an hour. Few to listen,
but that no matter. A rapt auditor in <span class="smcap">Old Morality</span>, sitting forward
with hands on knees, eyes reverently fixed on orator, drinking in his
honeyed words. Something paternal in his attitude towards Ministers.
Here and there they had done not quite the right thing. The <span class="smcap">Markiss</span>,
in particular, had been particularly harsh to Portugal; but, on the
whole, things might have been worse.</p>

<p>"Bless you, my children; bless you!" were the last words of the Grand
Old Man as he stretched forth his hands across the table. Not a dry
eye on the Treasury Bench. <span class="smcap">Old Morality</span> deeply touched, but through
his sobs managed to make acknowledgment of the unexpected clemency.
<i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Address Moved.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;The languor in which House steeped since Debate on
Address opened, not varied to-night till, at ten o'clock, copies of
Report of Parnell Commission brought to Vote Office. Then such a
scrimmage as never before seen.</p>

<p>At re-opening of Debate, <span class="smcap">Howorth</span> started off with reference to
Portugal. Immediately Members, with one consent, went forth,
discovering that they had special business in the Lobby, the Library,
the Tea-room, anywhere out of the House. The <span class="smcap">Sage of Queen Anne's Gate</span>
had not even waited for resumption of Debate to quit the scene; was
comfortably ensconsed in Smoking-room, distilling words of wisdom to
listening circle. Someone dropping in, accidentally mentioned that
<span class="smcap">Howorth</span> had brought on Portugal business. <span class="smcap">Sage</span> jumped up nearly as
high as <span class="smcap">Bond</span> when he saw the Mouse. Had an Amendment on the paper
referring to Portugal; had prepared a few paragraphs elucidating it.
If opportunity missed, speech would be lost. So bolted off; arrived
just in time to follow <span class="smcap">Howorth</span>. Whilst discoursing, Our Latest Duke
came in, fresh from the pageant of his installation in House of Lords.
Seated in Peers' Gallery, toying with his walking-stick, thinking no
evil, started to hear his name mentioned. <span class="smcap">Sage's</span> quick eye had caught
sight of him.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:50%">

    <p style='text-align: center;'>Fight for the Report of the Royal Commission.</p>
</div>

<p>"Halloa!" said the <span class="smcap">Sage</span> to himself, "here's a Duke; let's throw arf a
brick at him!"</p>

<p>So, with innocent manner and pretty assumption of ignorance of the
presence in Peers' Gallery of the highly favoured young gentleman with
the walking-stick, the <span class="smcap">Sage</span> traced all the evils of Central Africa,
leading directly up to the quarrel with Portugal, to the action of the
British South Africa Company, of which the Duke of <span class="smcap">Fife</span>, he said, was
a Promoter and Director.</p>

<p>"Very odd thing that, <span class="smcap">Toby</span>," said the Duke, under his breath, as he
left the Gallery on tip-toe; "most remarkable coincidence; odds seemed
to be a thousand to one against it; and yet it came off. Don't look
into Peers' Gallery twice a year; yet on very night I happened to be
there for five minutes, <span class="smcap">Labby</span> on his legs and talking about <span class="smcap">Me</span>!"</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Debate on Address.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;A dull night, uplifted, at outset, by powerful speech
from <span class="smcap">Parnell</span>, and, towards finish, by Colonel <span class="smcap">Saunderson</span> riding
in, and slashing off heads all round. After him came <span class="smcap">Sheehy</span>.
Splendid fellow, <span class="smcap">Sheehy</span>; must see more of him.</p>

<p>"What you want is blood!" <span class="smcap">Sheehy</span> shouted across the House
at <span class="smcap">Balfour</span>, lounging, dull and depressed, on Treasury Bench;
"I repeat the phrase&mdash;Blood!"</p>

<p>"Blood," said <span class="smcap">Saunderson</span>, carelessly passing his hand through
the black locks that crown his lofty brow, "is not exactly a phrase.
Besides, after eight hours of this, a cup of black coffee would be
more in <span class="smcap">Balfour's</span> way. But a good deal must be conceded to
<span class="smcap">Sheehy</span>. What a nation we are for genders! We had an <span class="smcap">O'Shea</span>,
we have an <span class="smcap">O'Hea</span>; and here's a <span class="smcap">Shee-he</span>. I have occasional

<h2>FIFTY YEARS OF RAILWAY PROGRESS&mdash;FIFTY YEARS HENCE.</h2>

<p>A large and attentive audience assembled yesterday evening to hear Mr.
<span class="smcap">Fairweather's</span> discourse on the highly interesting and instructive
subject of the progress made in the matter of Railway Travelling in
the course of the last fifty years.</p>

<p>The lecturer commenced by reminding his audience that, in the days of
their fathers and grandfathers, fifty years ago, towards the close of
the Nineteenth Century, the wretched Public had to content themselves
with a miserable conveyance called a Pullman Car, that they in those
days considered a triumph of elegant and convenient locomotion,
because they could get tucked away on a shelf at night as a sort of
apology for a bed, and be served with a mutton-chop by day, as a
makeshift for lunch, and this they considered wonderful, because they
were being dragged over their road at the marvellous, soul-thrilling
pace of sixty miles an hour. (<i>Loud laughter.</i>) What would the poor
benighted travellers of those days say to their present Grand Circular
Express, that ran from London to York in two-and-twenty minutes, and
ran up to the most northern point in Scotland, then down the Western
Coast to Land's End, and back again to London all along the Channel
Shore, doing the entire circuit in four hours and a quarter, and this
while you reclined on the rich red velvet cushions of the lofty and
sumptuously decorated third-class carriage at a one-and-ninepenny
fare? No wonder that people took monthly tickets, and went round, and
round, and round the two kingdoms; living, in fact, in the train, and
being thus perpetually on the move. Look at the advantages offered by
the Company, on their new extra-triple width line. A Brass Band, a
Theatrical Company, a Doctor, Dancing-Master, Teacher of Elocution,
Solicitor, Dentist, and Police Magistrate, accompanied every train,
which was, moreover, provided with Turkish Shower and Swimming Baths,
Billiard-rooms, Circulating Library, and offered attractive advantages
to families wishing, either at their doctor's orders or for the mere
sake of the run on its own account, continual change of air, complete
sets of handsomely furnished apartments not fitted up with sleeping
shelves&mdash;(<i>laughter</i>)&mdash;but supplied with regular six foot
four-posters, such as would have delighted the eyes of their great
grandfathers a hundred years ago. The law, too, recently passed, which
consigned a Director to penal servitude, in the event of a train being
ten minutes after its time, which had been passed owing to the
persistent unpunctuality of the South-Eastern Company, had worked
admirably, and to it, no doubt, they owed the present orderly
management of all the lines in the three kingdoms. What would be the
next development of Railway travelling he could not venture to
predict, but he thought that if, in the next fifty years, they made as
much progress as they had in the fifty years just expired, he was of
opinion, that though the shareholders might possibly receive a smaller
dividend even than that they were drawing to-day&mdash;(<i>loud
laughter</i>)&mdash;the Railway, as an institution in the country, could not
be regarded but as being in a highly flourishing condition.</p>

<p>A vote of thanks having been passed to the Lecturer for his lively and
instructive discourse, which he briefly acknowledged, the proceedings
terminated.</p>
